# SWIG wrapper for Python

* Prepare: packages _pkg-config_, _swig_ and _python3-dev_ (or they alternatives) should be installed before building

* To build the wrapper:

`make`

* This creates two files providing the module, _mis.py_ and __mis.so_, they can be safely moved to another directory

* To test the wrapper:

`make test`
